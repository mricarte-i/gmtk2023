# Tetris Trick: Block Dispatch Worker

Based on the 3D in 2D demo.
Hopefully playable by the end of the jam...

## Current state of the game:

### Missing:
 - Win condition and game over screen
 - Update tetris board to clean lines
 - Fix TetrisSim (seems like it won't attempt to clear lines when picking where to place a piece...)
 - More sound and stuff
 - Fix issue where blocks get stuck in boxes
